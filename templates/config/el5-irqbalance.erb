# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems.  The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds.  There is one configuration option:
#
# ONESHOT=yes
#    after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
#    load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
#    it again.

#
# IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK
#    bit bitmask which allows you to indicate which cpu's should
#    be skipped when reblancing irqs.  Cpu numbers which have their 
#    corresponding bits set to one in this mask will not have any
#    irq's assigned to them on rebalance

# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_INTERRUPTS
#    This is a space delimited listof  irqs that irqbalance should ignore 
#    when balancing them.

# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
#    bit mask to indicate cpus which should not have any irqs assigned to them.
#    Do not use this setting together with IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK, as it will
#    override this setting.  IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK is kept for backwards
